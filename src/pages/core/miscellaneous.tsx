            From Bulbapedia: Bulbasaur is a small, quadrupedal Pokémon that has blue-green skin with
            darker patches. It has red eyes with white pupils, pointed, ear-like structures on top
            of its head, and a short, blunt snout with a wide mouth. A pair of small, pointed teeth
            are visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with
            three sharp claws. On Bulbasaurs back is a green plant bulb, which is grown from a seed
            planted there at birth. The bulb also conceals two slender, tentacle-like vines and
            provides it with energy through photosynthesis as well as from the nutrient-rich seeds
            contained within.

        <p>Charizard description from Bulbapedia </p>
        Charizard is a draconic, bipedal Pokémon. It is primarily orange with a cream underside from
        the chest to the tip of its tail. It has a long neck, small blue eyes, slightly raised
        nostrils, and two horn-like structures protruding from the back of its rectangular head.
        There are two fangs visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is closed. Two large wings with
        blue-green undersides sprout from its back, and a horn-like appendage juts out from the top
        of the third joint of each wing. A single wing-finger is visible through the center of each
        wing membrane. Charizards arms are short and skinny compared to its robust belly, and each
        limb has three white claws. It has stocky legs with cream-colored soles on each of its
        plantigrade feet. The tip of its long, tapering tail burns with a sizable flame. As Mega
        Charizard X, its body and legs are more physically fit, though its arms remain thin. Its
        skin turns black with a sky-blue underside and soles. Two spikes with blue tips curve upward
        from the front and back of each shoulder, while the tips of its horns sharpen, turn blue,
        and curve slightly upward. Its brow and claws are larger, and its eyes are now red. It has
        two small, fin-like spikes under each horn and two more down its lower neck. The finger
        disappears from the wing membrane, and the lower edges are divided into large, rounded
        points. The third joint of each wing-arm is adorned with a claw-like spike. Mega Charizard X
        breathes blue flames out the sides of its mouth, and the flame on its tail now burns blue.
        It is said that its new power turns it black and creates more intense flames.
